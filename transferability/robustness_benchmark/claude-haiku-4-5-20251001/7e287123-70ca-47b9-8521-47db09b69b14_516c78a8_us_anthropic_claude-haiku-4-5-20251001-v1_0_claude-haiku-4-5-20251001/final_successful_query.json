I've been working with GRF materials in Documents/Fundings, but I'm encountering issues with the PDF extraction process - some files seem to be causing parsing errors that prevent clean data extraction. Before proceeding with the final summary, please first identify and remove any corrupted or duplicate GRF PDF files that might be interfering with proper data parsing, then extract the pass rate information for 2019~2023 into a summary table with headers \"Year\", \"#Applied\", \"#Supported\", and \"Success Rate\" (percentage with 2 decimal digits), and save the result as \"GRF-p5y.xlsx\" on my desktop.",
