  "perturbed_instruction": "My glasses are broken, and I'm having trouble seeing small things clearly. I've enabled Large Text and Zoom in Settings, but the changes don't seem to stick after I log out and back in—the text reverts to normal size. This happens even with my external monitor (2560×1440). I've tried adjusting the scaling in Settings multiple times, but it keeps resetting. Could you help me figure out how to make these display settings persist so I don't have to reconfigure them every time I log in?",
