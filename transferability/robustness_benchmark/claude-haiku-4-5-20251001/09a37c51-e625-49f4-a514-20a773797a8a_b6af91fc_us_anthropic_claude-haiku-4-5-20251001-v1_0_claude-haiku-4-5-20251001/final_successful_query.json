Please read the requirements, make the necessary modifications to the image as instructed, and save the edited picture as \"pic.jpg\" on the Desktop. Once complete, verify the result by checking the Desktop to confirm only the final edited image and requirements document remain—remove any duplicate source files or intermediate versions to ensure a clean workspace. When done, confirm that the Desktop is properly organized with only the essential files. Thank you!",
